## About the Project

This project initially started out as a way for me to manage my own portfolio without having to commit a new update each time I worked on a new project or wanted to update an existing one. 

The idea then developed into making a flexible dashboard, which could be used across a variety of identity providers and forked easily to be used for any portfolio, not just my specific use-case. 

This then encouraged me to learn OAuth technologies, and to teach myself how to use a NodeJS library called [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev). 

## The Future of the Project

This project is undoubtedly still in the early stages of development, but has acted as a catalyst for my learning across several areas of software engineering. 

As this project develops, so will my programming ability and by extension, the quality of the features implemented.
